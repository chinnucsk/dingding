A way to check if a module implements a behaviour:
dd_connection:module_info(attributes).
[{vsn,[217146057478470812520104193448891454124]},
 {behaviour,[gen_server]}]

Different behaviours?
Could implement one that is basicly a gen_server so that it can have local state.

make a webbased frontend (or staticly generated paged) for the links dingding stores in the db.
For this we first need to get the db to work properly.

URL storing could be done with the URL as primary key, so that every url only gets reported once to the RSS feed.

Add Luerl scripting capabilities to dingd1ng?

URL handler module needs to be completely reworked in order to use the new db functionality.
Get the title of the URL first, then do everything else.
Since we need the title in so many places.


 {modules, [{"#channel", [mod1, mod2]}, {"#channel", [mod1, mod2]}...
 then {channel_modules, } ..
 So modules per channel, not channel per module.
 For ease of config, I could include a 'standard_modules' section, for modules that work on all channels?
 server_modules, channel_modules
